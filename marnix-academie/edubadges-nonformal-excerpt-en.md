# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/marnix-academie/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Stichting Protestants Christelijk Hoger Beroepsonderwijs Utrecht is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Marnix Academie uses edubadges to recognize and value the learning outcomes of formal and non-formal education. With this, we endorse the importance of Lifelong Development and make education more accessible for a wider audience and make acquired competences visible to the participant himself and the (future) employer.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Stichting Protestants Christelijk Hoger Beroepsonderwijs Utrecht) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [fg@hsmarnix.nl](mailto:fg@hsmarnix.nl).
