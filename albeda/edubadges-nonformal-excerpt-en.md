# Terms of use for this edubadge

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/albeda/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Albeda Foundation is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Albeda wants to experiment further with edubadges with the aim of creating a general badge strategy. There are two tracks for this experiment, one for students and one for employees:

1. Students: edubadges for 21st century skills that students attain by extracurricular citizenship activities like the social service (MDT), Albeda Next, student councils etc.
2. Employees: edubadges for Albeda employee professionalization in the fields of digital literacy via the Albeda Academy..

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Albeda Foundation) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [fg@albeda.nl](mailto:fg@albeda.nl).
