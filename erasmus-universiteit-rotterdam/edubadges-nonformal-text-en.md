# General

Erasmus University Rotterdam (hereinafter referred to as EUR) uses the edubadges service. Edubadges is a digital infrastructure for creating and issuing edubadges for education and research in the Netherlands.

In the context of educational flexibility and lifelong learning, students are encouraged to work on their own professional development by taking normal and extracurricular courses, workshops and educational modules. An edubadge is a digital certificate that includes information about the contents of the learning results achieved. Edubadges give students visible evidence to show that they have mastered certain knowledge and skills.

# Who is responsible for your personal data?

The edubadges service uses the technical infrastructure that SURF has developed especially for edubadges. SURF is responsible for creating and maintaining user accounts. SURF is the collaborative organisation for ICT for educational and research institutions in the Netherlands.

When generating and issuing the edubadges, EUR acts as the controller within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

# Whose personal data does EUR process, what personal data are processed and for what purposes?

EUR collects personal data from the following categories of data subjects:

**Students**

The first name, surname, e-mail address, institution name and eduID of students who are given edubadges are processed as personal data.

Besides the normal curriculum, students are encouraged to attend workshops and other activities that are not part of the normal curriculum. After successfully completing these courses, workshops and other activities, a digital certificate in the form of an edubadge is awarded to students to demonstrate that they have acquired the knowledge and skills.

# On what grounds is the processing of your personal data based?

All processing of personal data has to be based on Article 6 of the GDPR. EUR processes personal data on the following grounds:

**Because it is necessary for the implementation of an agreement**

Students from other educational institutions and course participants who enrol for contract education courses for which the EUR awards an edubadge to the student and/or course participant once they have passed the course.

**Legal obligation**

Students who complete the compulsory curriculum for their chosen field of study, for which an edubadge may be awarded for some courses.

**Legitimate interest**

Students who follow extracurricular workshops, modules and other EUR activities that are not part of their own study.

# Are your personal data disclosed to third parties?

Apart from the EUR, students’ personal data are given to SURF for creating and maintaining the user accounts of edubadge recipients. SURF also uses this data to validate edubadges.

EUR reaches agreements with SURF to safeguard the confidentiality of personal data and to ensure that the data are handled with due care.

# For how long are your data kept?
The intention is that edubadges should last a lifetime. For this reason, no retention period has been set. That said, students do have the option of closing their user account for validating the edubadges. The personal data of data subjects that have been collected on SURF’s edubadges platform will then be retained for one month at most after the account has been deleted.

# Are your personal data protected at EUR?

EUR values your privacy. So we take security measures to prevent the theft, loss or otherwise unlawful use of your personal data. We protect your data by minimising access rights, using encryption, monitoring use, and applying additional measures to the extent that the current state of the art allows for this.

# Your rights and exercising these rights (digital portal)

To request access, changes or amendments to your personal data on SURF’s edubadges platform, you can submit a request via the privacy organisation’s digital portal. For this, please see the [EUR’s general privacy statement](https://eur.nl/disclaimer/privacy-statement).
