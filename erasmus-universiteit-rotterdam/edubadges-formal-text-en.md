# Privacyverklaring

We appreciate your interest in the privacy statement of Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR). We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. This statement explains how we handle your data. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns after reading this statement, please feel free to contact us at [privacy@eur.nl](mailto:privacy@eur.nl).

## 1 What are edubadges?

An edubadge, as issued by Erasmus University Rotterdam, is a digital certificate (in the form of an image) that indicates the holder possesses specific knowledge or skills. The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others, for example, on social media, in a digital CV, or with an educational institution or (potential) employer.

## 2 What are microcredentials?

A microcredential is a reliable certificate that allows learners to demonstrate what they know, can do, and understand upon successful completion of a unit of study. In other words, a microcredential assigns independent value to a smaller unit of education. However, it is not only about the end result. The entire process-including the learning activities and the assessment of learning outcomes-contributes to the value of a microcredential, which is recognized both within and outside educational institutions. Microcredentials add a quality mark to small-scale educational modules. This enables professionals and other participants to showcase their achievements and the level of the program, supporting further flexibility in education.

Issuing edubadges and microcredentials requires a technical infrastructure. SURF has developed this infrastructure to securely issue, store, and validate edubadges and microcredentials within its systems. In this privacy statement, the term "edubadges" also includes microcredentials. More information about edubadges can be found on [SURF's website](https://surf.nl/edubadges).

## 3 What is the edubadges platform?

SURF edubadges is the national platform for digital certificates in Dutch higher education. Every digital certificate issued via the edubadges platform is referred to as an edubadge. The term "edubadges" is therefore a collective name for various types of digital certificates that can be issued through the edubadges service.

## 4 Purpose and processing

EUR uses edubadges service to issue edubadges. The edubadges service is divided into two parts:
