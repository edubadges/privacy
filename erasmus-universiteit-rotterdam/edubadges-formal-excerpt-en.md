# Edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges service and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/erasmus-universiteit-rotterdam/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) is the data controller, and SURF acts as the data processor for the issuance of edubadges and microcredentials. The term edubadges also encompasses microcredentials in this context.

EUR uses the edubadges service to issue microcredentials and edubadges. Microcredentials are formally recognized, small-scale educational units that carry a quality mark. These microcredentials help professionals and other learners demonstrate their achievements and the level of education attained, thereby supporting greater flexibility in educational pathways. Edubadges are digital certificates that represent the achievement of specific learning outcomes, often used to make skills and competencies visible in a verifiable way.

To enable the functionality of the edubadges service the processing of certain personal data is necessary. The following personal data is processed: your first and last name, a unique identifier, and your email address. Additionally, the edubadge includes your eduID and relevant metadata, such as the date of issuance, the issuer (Erasmus University Rotterdam), and information about the specific achievement, educational module, and/or learning outcomes.
