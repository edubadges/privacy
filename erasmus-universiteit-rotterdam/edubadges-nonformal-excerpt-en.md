# Edubadges and your privacy

Erasmus University Rotterdam (hereinafter referred to as EUR) handles personal data with care and acts within the limits of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Below is an outline of the most important aspects of edubadges and your privacy. The full text with information on how the EUR processes your data for issuing edubadges is given below. EUR is responsible for processing applications for edubadges.

* EURâ€™s aim when granting edubadges is to promote your own professional development and to present evidence of this development. An edubadge demonstrates that you have mastered certain skills or knowledge.
* EUR processes personal data when awarding edubadges, namely your first name, surname, e-mail address, name of the institution and eduID.
* EUR uses edubadges both within the normal curriculum and for activities that are not part of this curriculum. Depending on the activity for which you are applying for an edubadge, one of the following grounds applies:
  * Legal obligation: courses and modules that are part of the compulsory curriculum.
  * Necessary for the implementation of an agreement: non-EUR students who are getting a contract education at the EUR.
  * Legitimate interest: workshops, modules, courses that are not part of the normal curriculum.
* If you have any questions about logging in, creating, issuing or managing edubadges, please send your question to [support@edubadges.nl](mailto:support@edubadges.nl). If you have other questions, send them to [edubadges@eur.nl](mailto:edubadges@eur.nl).
* To request access, rectification and additions, restriction of processing, data portability and erasure of your personal data, you can submit a request to the privacy organisation via the digital portal.

* If the EUR processes your personal data on the grounds of a legitimate interest, you have the right to object to the processing.
* You are also entitled to lodge a complaint with the Dutch Data Protection Authority.
