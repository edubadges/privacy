# Privacy Statement Formal edubadges
The University of Groningen, located at Broerstraat 5, 9712CP Groningen, wants to handle the personal data of everyone who applies for an edubadge in a careful manner. In this Privacy Statement we inform you about the purposes for which personal data are processed, how you can exercise your privacy rights as well as other information which may be of interest to you. If you have any questions, comments or concerns after reading this privacy statement, please send an email to [privacy@rug.nl](mailto:privacy@rug.nl).

This Privacy Statement applies to all activities related to the edubadges in the context of the ENLIGHT program of the University of Groningen, hereinafter referred to as RUG. RUG handles personal data with due care and acts within the limits of the law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1) Introduction of edubadges
Edubadges can be used to give substance to "lifelong learning" and flexible education within and outside RUG. The purpose of the edubadge is to make the knowledge and skills that you master visible and portable. As a recipient of an edubadge, you can share it with others, for example on social media, in a digital resume, with an educational institution or with a (potential) employer. With SURF's edubadges platform, RUG can create and issue edubadges. You can request and receive edubadges via this platform. There is a distinction between formal and non-formal edubadges. This Privacy Statement applies to formal badges.

## 2) Responsibility
The RUG is the data controller, as referred to in the GDPR, for requesting and issuing edubadges. RUG believes it is essential that the personal data of its students and employees are handled and secured with the greatest possible care. We also want to be open about how your data is processed by us. That is why we would like to elaborate upon this in this Privacy Statement. We always comply with the requirements set out by the GDPR. If you have any questions about our processing, please contact [privacy@rug.nl](mailto:privacy@rug.nl).

## 3) What Personal data do we process and why do we process it?
Your Personal data is being processed will be used by RUG to register, generate and issue valid and personal edubadges. The issue of the edubadge by RUG can only be carried out by using your personal data. RUG processes this data on the legal bases of "public interest". The table below includes personal data (with purpose and basis) that are processed by students. To request an edubadge, the institution's account is verified with the eduID. To generate a badge, the eduID is used for identification and validation. A badge is therefore also personal data in itself.

| Personal data	| Processing Goal | Legal basis |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| First name | To identify the receiver of the edubadge	| Student as data subject: public interest. |
| Surname | To identify the receiver of the edubadge | Student as data subject: public interest. |
| Email address | To notify the receiver of the edubadge | Student as data subject: public interest. |
| Scoped affiliation | Used to obtain all educational institutions associated with the recipient's eduID | Student as data subject: public interest. |
| Agreement privacy questions | A record is kept of whether the privacy questions have been agreed to | Student as data subject: public interest. |
| eduID | The eduID is used as a unique identifier in the database and as a pseudonymous identifier in badges | Student as data subject: public interest. |
| Edubadge and its contents	| To generate and issue the edubadges | Student as data subject: public interest. |

The processing takes place on the basis of the 'public interest'. In the context of this public interest, the following has been considered:

The primary task of the RUG is to provide educational activities. In that context, the RUG wants to continue to innovate. The RUG wants to give substance to the principle of lifelong learning and to making education more flexible; two goals set out in the 2021-2026 strategic plan. These goals can be achieved by using edubadges. At the same time, edubadges may qualify as micro-credential in the future. A micro-credential is a qualification that demonstrates learning outcomes acquired through a short, transparently assessed course or module. Within the European Union, the European Commission aims to develop a common definition and European standards for microcredentials, independent of the granting authority, and building as much as possible on existing instruments. The intention to develop a European approach to micro-credentials was announced in, among others, the Digital Education Action Plan (2021-2027).

Within the ENLIGHT programme, edubadges makes learning outcomes, assessments and certification of educational components more transparent for students the RUG wants to investigate whether edubadges can make education more flexible and accessible. The ENLIGHT program seeks to learn about the requirements for the use of micro-credentials, explore existing and future micro-learning opportunities, develop an educational philosophy for micro-credentials and seek to prepare for the future of higher education.
