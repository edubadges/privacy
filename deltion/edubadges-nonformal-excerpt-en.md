Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/deltion/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Deltion is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Deltion) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact the Privacy Officer of Deltion via the ASP ([3333@deltion.nl](mailto:3333@deltion.nl)).
