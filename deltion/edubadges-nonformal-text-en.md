# 1 Introduction

An edubadge is a digital badge (image) which shows that the holder has certain knowledge or skills. The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others, for example on social media, on a digital CV, or with an educational institution or (potential) employer.

A technical infrastructure is required in order to create and award edubadges. SURF has developed the infrastructure for issuing edubadges and the edubadges are stored securely and can be validated within SURF's systems. More information about edubadges can be found on [SURF's website](https://surf.nl/edubadges).

# 2 Purpose and processing

The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1):
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing an edubadges (2):
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
