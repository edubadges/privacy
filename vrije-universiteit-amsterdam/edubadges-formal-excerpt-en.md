# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/vrije-universiteit-amsterdam/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

The VU is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. The VU uses edubadges for the recognition and validation of knowledge and professional skills from non-formal education.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (the VU) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact privacy@vu.nl.
