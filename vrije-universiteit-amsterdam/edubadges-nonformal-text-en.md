Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (hereinafter VU) considers privacy important and hence to protect your personal data. In this privacy statement, we describe how we handle your personal data for the service edubadges. We process your personal data in accordance with the applicable privacy legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Dutch Data Protection Implementation Act (UAVG).

An edubadge is a digital badge (image), which shows that the recipient has certain knowledge or skills. The file contains the description of this knowledge and skill and the issuer of the badge. The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others, for example on social media, a digital CV, an educational institution or with a (potential) employer.

A technical infrastructure is necessary in order to create and issue edubadges. SURF (a cooperative association of Dutch educational and research institutions) has developed that infrastructure for issuing edubadges, with the edubadges being securely stored and validated within SURF. More information about edubadges can be found on the SURF website.

# 1 Who is responsible for processing my personal data?

The VU uses edubadges for the recognition and validation of knowledge and professional skills from non-formal education.

The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1):

  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing an edubadges (2):
  * Registering for edubadges

SURF is the data controller for the account/backpack (1). See the privacy statement at edubadges.nl. If you have any questions, please send an e-mail to support@edubadges.nl.

The VU Foundation is responsible for issuing edubadges (2) and the associated data processing. As a special institution under the terms of the Higher Education and Scientific Research Act (WHW), the VU Foundation maintains the VU.

In processing your personal data, we may use service providers (processors) who process your personal data on behalf and under the responsibility of the VU.
