We are glad that youâ€™re reading the privacy statement of Curio for the service edubadges! We have paid a lot of attention to the protection of your personal data, and you can read all about it in this privacy statement. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please email [j.vandenhazelkamp@curio.nl](mailto:j.vandenhazelkamp@curio.nl).

# 1 Introduction

An edubadge is a digital badge (image) which shows that the holder has certain knowledge or skills. The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others, for example on social media, on a digital CV, or with an educational institution or (potential) employer.

A technical infrastructure is required in order to create and award edubadges. SURF has developed the infrastructure for issuing edubadges and the edubadges are stored securely and can be validated within SURF's systems. More information about edubadges can be found on [SURF's website](https://surf.nl/edubadges).

# 2 Purpose and processing

In the context of making education more flexible and making lifelong development possible, Curio issues EduBadges. The EduBadge enables the owner to better position himself in the labor market and demonstrates that the owner has certain knowledge and skills. This fits in with our vision of flexible and adaptive education.

The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1):
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing an edubadges (2):
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
  * Issuing an edubadge

For the account/backpack (1), SURF is the controller. See the [privacy statement of edubadges.nl](https://edubadges.nl/privacy) for more information. You can contact [support@edubadges.nl](mailto:support@edubadges.nl) with questions. For issuing edubadges (2), Curio is the controller and SURF is the processor. This privacy statement relates to the processing by Curio.
