# Edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/mbo/roc-mondriaan/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

ROC Mondriaan is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. ROC Mondriaan wants to provide students with digital evidence by awarding edubadges. With edubadges, students can demonstrate that they have certain skills and/or knowledge.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifiere and email address are processed. In addition, the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (ROC Mondriaan) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [ibp@rocmondriaan.nl](mailto:ibp@rocmondriaan.nl).
