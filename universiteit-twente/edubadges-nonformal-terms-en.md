`Version 1.0 – 18 November 2020`

We are glad that you’re reading the privacy statement of the University of Twente (UT) for the service edubadge! We have paid a lot of attention to the protection of your personal data, and you can read all about it in this privacy statement. If you have any questions, comments or concerns after reading this privacy statement, please email [dpo@utwente.nl](mailto:dpo@utwente.nl).

# 1 Introduction edubadges
An edubadge is a digital insignia (pictured) that shows that the recipient has certain knowledge or skills. The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others, for example on social media, a digital cv, an educational institution or with a potential employer.

A technical infrastructure is required to create and award edubadges. SURF has developed this edubadges publishing infrastructure, in which the edubadges can be stored and validated safely within SURF. More information about edubadges can be found on [SURF's website](https://www.surf.nl/en/edubadges-issuing-digital-certificates-to-students).

# 2 Processing
The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1) -> SURF is controller, see [SURF's privacy statement](https://edubadges.nl/privacy).
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing edubadges (2) -> University of Twente is controller
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
  * Issuing an edubadge

For the user account, the storage of edubadges and the validation of edubadges (1), SURF is the controller. You can contact [support@edubadges.nl](mailto:support@edubadges.nl) with questions about this processing.

For the issue of edubadges (2), the University of Twente is the controller and SURF is the processor. This privacy statement relates primarily to the processing by the University of Twente.

# 3 Personal data
## What personal data do we use and why?
For the functioning of the edubadge platform, it is necessary to process personal data. The students receive edubadges as a service of the UT providing the student with a digital evidence by issuing edubadge, with which he or she can demonstrate that he or she possesses certain skills and/or knowledge.

For issueing of edubadges, we see three forms of processing:

1. Registering for edubadge
