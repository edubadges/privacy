`Version 1.0 – 18 November 2020`

We are glad that you’re reading the privacy statement of the University of Twente (UT) for the service edubadges! We have paid a lot of attention to the protection of your personal data, and you can read all about it in this privacy statement. If you have any questions, comments or concerns after reading this privacy statement, please email [dpo@utwente.nl](mailto:dpo@utwente.nl).

# 1. Introduction edubadges
An edubadge is a digital insignia (image) that shows that the recipient has acquired certain knowledge or skills. The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others via social media, for example with a potential employer or an educational institution.

A technical infrastructure is required to create and award edubadges. SURF has developed this edubadges publishing infrastructure, in which the edubadges can be stored and validated safely within SURF. More information about edubadges can be found on [SURF's website](https://www.surf.nl/en/edubadges-issuing-digital-certificates-to-students).

# 2. Processing
The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1) -> SURF is controller, see [SURF's privacy statement](https://edubadges.nl/privacy).
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing edubadges (2) -> University of Twente is controller
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
  * Issuing an edubadge

For the user account, the storage of edubadges and the validation of edubadges (1), SURF is the controller. You can contact [support@edubadges.nl](mailto:support@edubadges.nl) with questions about this processing.

For the issue of edubadges (2), the University of Twente is the controller and SURF is the processor. This privacy statement relates primarily to the processing by the University of Twente.

# 3. Personal data
What personal data do we use and why? For the functioning of the edubadges platform, it is necessary to process personal data. The students receive edubadges as a service of the UT providing the student with a digital evidence by issuing edubadges, with which he or she can demonstrate that he or she possesses certain skills and/or knowledge.

For issueing of edubadges, we see three forms of processing:

1. Registering for edubadge
2. Generating edubadge
3. Sending edubadge

# 4. Security
Among other things, the following security measures have been put in place to protect personal data:

* All physical and virtual servers and data are located in SURF data centres in the Netherlands. The edubadges service is hosted redundantly at SURF locations Nikhef and InterXion.

* Access to the management side of the edubadges service is shielded through VPN and hardened configuration for access itself.
