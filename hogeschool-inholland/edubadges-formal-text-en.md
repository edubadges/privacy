We are glad that youâ€™re reading the privacy statement of Inholland University of Applied Sciences for the service edubadges! We have paid a lot of attention to the protection of your personal data, and you can read all about it in this privacy statement. If you have any questions, comments or concerns after reading this privacy statement, please email [functionarisgegevensbescherming@inholland.nl](mailto:functionarisgegevensbescherming@inholland.nl).

# 1 Introduction

The Edubadges service is a digital infrastructure for creating and issuing digital evidence of completed units of study or other learning objectives to students. This digital evidence, in this case the microcredential, provides for the further flexibilisation of education in order to follow courses both within and outside one's own university. Microcredentials are linked to ECTS (study credits) that are linked to educational units you have completed and that are awarded by the university's examiner and examination board.

In order to enable the creation and issue (register-generate-send) of microcredentials to students, personal data is exchanged with SURF, the umbrella organisation for research universities and universities of applied sciences in the Netherlands. In order to prevent fraud, checks are made to verify the applicant and to whom the microcredentials are issued. The system used to create, request and issue microcredentials complies with SURF's information security requirements (SURF standards framework), which is based on ISO 27001 and which Inholland also uses to organise the processing of personal data.

# 2 Purpose and processing

Inholland considers it a legitimate interest to exchange the personal data of the students concerned with SURF in order to facilitate the digitizing of evidence in the form of microcredentials and to enable the flexibilization of education for the students. SURF carried out a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) for the microcredentials service, which was supplemented with regard to specific processing by Inholland University of Applied Sciences.

The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1):
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing an edubadges (2):
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
  * Issuing an edubadge

For the account/backpack (1), SURF is the controller. See the [privacy statement of edubadges.nl](https://edubadges.nl/privacy) for more information. You can contact [support@edubadges.nl](mailto:support@edubadges.nl) with questions. For issuing edubadges (2), Inholland University of Applied Sciences is the controller and SURF is the processor. This privacy statement relates primarily to the processing by Inholland University of Applied Sciences.

# 3 Personal data

For issuing edubadges, there are three forms of processing:

1. Registering for an edubadge
2. Creating the edubadge
3. Sending the edubadge

In the table below are the personal data (with purpose and basis) that are processed when registering for an edubadge, when the edubadge is created and when the edubadge is send to the recipient. This personal data is obtained by linking to the user his/her eduID account.

| Personal data	| Purpose	| Basis |
| ------------- | ------- | ----- |
| eduID	| Pseudonym identifier in edubadge | Legitimate interest |
| Given name(s) | User identification | Legitimate interest |
| Surname | User identification | Legitimate interest |
| Email address | User Notification	| Legitimate interest |
| Educational institution | Demarcation of available edubadges | Legitimate interest |
| Unique identifier | Make it possible to award edubadges directly to the student | Legitimate interest |
| Privacy interaction | Whether the privacy statement has been read | Legitimate interest |

Inholland University of Applied Sciences has access to your first name, last name and email address. SURF and its management partner has access to all personal data. The personal data are not provided to other parties.

# 4 Security

Security measures, including the following, have been taken to protect personal data:

* Only the personal data associated with the eduID is stored in the edubadge.
* Communication between systems is encrypted in accordance with the state of the art and best practices.
* An extensive independent security audit (code review and penetration testing) took place before the systems went live.
* The edubadges service will be audited regularly.
* Access to servers is secured in accordance with the state of the art in security technology, standards and best practices.
* All physical and virtual servers and data are located in SURF's data centres in the Netherlands. The edubadges service is hosted redundantly at SURF's Nikhef and InterXion locations.
* All operating systems and software are kept up-to-date.
* Access to the administration side of the edubadges service is shielded by VPN and a hardened configuration for the access itself.
* Backups of the production environment are made daily.
* Servers, operating systems and applications are protected by a restrictive firewall.
* Actions in the operating system and actions taken to issue edubadges are all logged.
* The web server uses a hardened configuration and security headers in accordance with best practices.
* Employee account roles access in edubadges is limited to only the personal data that is relevant to them.
