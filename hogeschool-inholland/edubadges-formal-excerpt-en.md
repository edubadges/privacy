# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/hogeschool-inholland/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Inholland University of Applied Sciences is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. In order to prevent fraud, checks are made to verify the applicant and to whom the edubadge is being issued.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Inholland University of Applied Sciences) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [functionarisgegevensbescherming@inholland.nl](mailto:functionarisgegevensbescherming@inholland.nl).
