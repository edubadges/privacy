Windesheim is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Edubadges, including Microcredentials, are used with the aim of better positioning students in the changing labor market and as an incentive for our students by visualizing achieved results and recognition of skills. In addition, it offers an option to automate the associated administrative certificates process.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifiere and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Windesheim) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes.
