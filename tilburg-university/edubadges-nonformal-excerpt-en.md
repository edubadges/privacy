# Terms of use for this edubadge

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/tilburg-university/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Tilburg University is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. ## 1) Post-initial education
By introducing Edubadges for professionals, Leven Lang Ontwikkelen (Lifelong Development; abrievated as LLO) can receive an enormous boost. Many institutions have the ambition to make education from their own portfolio suitable for Leven Lang Ontwikkelen. The scope and value of microcredentials make it attractive for professionals to specialize, retrain, or reskill in higher education and make the acquired competencies visible to the outside world.

## 2) Additional curricular activities for students
Within TiU, informal badges are used as a recognition of knowledge/skills acquired extra-curricularly, e.g. board work, so not linked to accredited education. The added value here is to also make the extra-curricularly acquired skills visible to the outside world, e.g. to employers. Also, these badges can offer students insight and reflection on which knowledge and skills they have acquired..

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Tilburg University) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [privacy@tilburguniversity.edu](mailto:privacy@tilburguniversity.edu).
