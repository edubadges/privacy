# Formal edubadges and your privacy
Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/tu-eindhoven/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. TU/e uses edubadges to issue Microcredentials. Microcredentials add a quality mark to small sized educational units. This enables professionals and other participants to visualize achieved results and the level of education, which supports further flexibilization of the education.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (TU/e) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [privacy@tue.nl](privacy@tue.nl).
