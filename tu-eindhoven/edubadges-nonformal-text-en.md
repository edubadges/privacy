# Privacy Statement Formal and Nonformal Edubadges
This privacy statement provides information about the processing of personal data of everyone who applies for, or receives, an Edubadge at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). If after reading the privacy statement you have any questions about the way we process your personal data, please let us know via [privacy@tue.nl](privacy@tue.nl). We are happy to help you.

This privacy statement applies to all activities related to the edubadges of TU/e. The TU/e Executive Board is the controller in the sense of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the processing operations in this privacy statement. This means that the TU/e Executive Board (hereafter referred to as "TU/e", "we" or "us") is responsible for the careful and proper processing of your personal data.

## 1) What are Edubadges?
Edubadges can be used to give substance to "lifelong learning" and flexibilisation within and outside the TU/e. The purpose of the Edubadge is to make the knowledge and skills that you master visible and portable. As a recipient of an Edubadge, you can share it with others, for example on social media, in a digital resume, with an educational institution or with a (potential) employer. With SURF's Edubadges platform, TU/e can create and issue Edubadges. You can request and receive Edubadges via this platform. There is a distinction between formal and non-formal Edubadges. This Privacy Statement applies to formal and non-formal badges.

## 2) Responsibility
The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1):
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing an edubadges (2):
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
  * Issuing an edubadge

For the user account, the storage of Edubadges and the validation of Edubadges (1), SURF is the controller. You can contact [support@edubadges.nl](mailto:support@edubadges.nl) with questions about this processing.
  
For the issue of Edubadges, TU/e is the controller and SURF is the processor. This privacy statement relates primarily to the processing by TU/e. We believe it is essential that the personal data of students and employees are handled and secured with the greatest possible care. We also want to be open about how your data is processed by us. That is why we would like to elaborate upon this in this Privacy Statement. We always comply with the requirements set out by the GDPR. If you have any questions about our processing, please contact [privacy@tue.nl](privacy@tue.nl).

## 3) What personal data do we process and why do we process it?
Your personal data is being processed by TU/e to register, generate and issue valid and personal Edubadges. The Edubadge can only be issued by TU/e using your personal data. We process this data on the legal bases of "public interest" and “legitimate interest”. The table below includes personal data (with purpose and basis) that are processed by us. To request an Edubadge, the institution's account is verified with the eduID. To generate a badge, the eduID is used for identification and validation. A badge is therefore also personal data in itself.

| Personal data	| Processing goal | Legal basis |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| First name(s) | To identify the receiver of the Edubadge | Formal Edubadges: public interest (public task). Non-formal Edubadges: legitimate interest. |
| Surname | | First name(s) | To identify the receiver of the Edubadge | Formal Edubadges: public interest (public task). Non-formal Edubadges: legitimate interest. |
| Email address	| To notify the receiver of the Edubadge | Formal Edubadges: public interest (public task). Non-formal Edubadges: legitimate interest. |
| Scoped affiliation | Used to obtain all educational institutions associated with the recipient's eduID | Formal Edubadges: public interest (public task). Non-formal Edubadges: legitimate interest. |
| Agreement privacy questions | A record is kept of whether the privacy questions have been agreed to | Formal Edubadges: public interest (public task). Non-formal Edubadges: legitimate interest. |
| eduID	| The eduID is used as a unique identifier in the database and as a pseudonymous identifier in badges | Formal Edubadges: public interest (public task). Non-formal Edubadges: legitimate interest. |
| Edubadge and its contents | To generate and issue the Edubadges | Formal Edubadges: public interest (public task).. Non-formal Edubadges: legitimate interest. |

Part of the processing takes place on the basis of legitimate interest. In the context of this legitimate interest, the following has been considered:

The underlying interest of TU/e is that it wants to keep up with educational innovations. We want to give substance to 'lifelong learning' and to 'making education more flexible' for students and employees’. In addition, one of TU/e’s aims is to recognize and reward talents, engage people in active learning, and attract people from different backgrounds and disciplines. These goals are line with TU/e Strategy for 2030, and these interests are served by the deployment of Edubadges.

Thus, it can be concluded that TU/e has a legitimate interest when it comes to this processing of personal data and that the privacy interests of those involved do not outweigh this interest. The data subjects can benefit from the deployment of Edubadges and can choose how to use and share them, and with whom.

## 4) With whom do we share your data?
The basic principle is that your personal data will only be used by TU/e. Only employees who need the data to carry out their work have access to your personal data. On behalf of the TU/e, SURF B.V. manages the Edubadge platform and handles the accompanying service provision. SURF is a processor of the TU/e and written agreements have been made with SURF to safeguard the security and careful handling of your personal data.

Please note all data regarding Edubadges is stored on servers in the EER. No data is stored outside of the EER for the Edubadges, nor is it shared with parties outside of the EER.

## 5) How does TU/e ensure confidential handling of personal data?
We have ensured the confidentiality and security of your personal data with appropriate physical, technical and organizational measures. This prevents the loss or unlawful processing of your personal data. Furthermore, your personal data can only be viewed by employees who, based on their position, are authorized to do so.

## 6) How long does TU/e store your data?
TU/e stores your data regarding grades and achievements and what courses or activities you participated in as part of an Edubadge, for 7 years after you left TU/e. The Edubadge platform (managed by SURF) stores your data for a different period of time. You can find more information here: [SURF's website or contact](https://www.surf.nl/en/edubadges-issuing-digital-certificates-to-students) [support@edubadges.nl](support@edubadges.nl).

## 7) How can you view, correct or delete your data?
You have a number of rights with respect to your personal data:

* Right of access. This is the right to obtain confirmation from us as to whether or not your personal data are being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and some additional information.
* Right to erasure.
* Right to rectification and supplementation. This is the right to have personal data that we process amended.
* Right to data portability. The right to data portability allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services.
* Right to restrict the data processing. This right allows you to limit the way that we use your data.
* Right to object to data processing. Would you like to exercise any of these rights? If so, please contact privacy@tue.nl. We will request additional information to verify your identity when invoking these rights.

## 8) Questions

If you do not agree with the complaint handling by the FG, you can file a complaint directly with the Dutch Data Protection Authority.
