We are glad that youâ€™re reading the terms of use of SURF for the service edubadges! We have paid a lot of attention to the protection of your personal data, and you can read all about it in these terms of service. 

To receive this edubadge, you must agree with these terms of service. If you have any questions, comments or concerns, please email [edubadges@surf.nl](mailto:edubadges@surf.nl).

# 1 Introduction

An edubadge is a digital badge (image) which shows that the holder has certain knowledge or skills. The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others, for example on social media, on a digital CV, or with an educational institution or (potential) employer.

A technical infrastructure is required to create and award edubadges. SURF has developed the infrastructure for issuing edubadges and the edubadges are stored securely and can be validated within SURF's systems. More information about edubadges can be found on [SURF's website](https://surf.nl/edubadges).

# 2 Purpose and processing

SURF wants to provide employees with digital evidence by awarding edubadges. With edubadges, employees can demonstrate that they have certain skills and/or knowledge.

The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1):
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing an edubadges (2):
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
  * Issuing an edubadge

For both parts SURF is the controller. See the [privacy statement of edubadges.nl](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/surf/account-statement-en.md) for more information. If you have questions you can contact [support@edubadges.nl](mailto:support@edubadges.nl).

# 3 Personal data

For issuing edubadges, there are three forms of processing:

1. Registering for an edubadge
2. Creating the edubadge
3. Sending the edubadge

In the table below are the personal data (with purpose and basis) that are processed when registering for an edubadge, when the edubadge is created and when the edubadge is send to the recipient. This personal data is obtained by linking to the user his/her eduID account.

| Privacy interaction | Whether the privacy statement has been read | Performance of an agreement |
| Result | A result is optional | Performance of an agreement |
| Date | Date when the edubadge was issued | Performance of an agreement |

These personal data are processed until the user deletes the edubadge + 1 month because of backups.

SURF and her management partners (Proxy Services B.V.) have access to all personal data. The personal data are not provided to other parties.
