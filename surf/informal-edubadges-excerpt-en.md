# Edubadges and your privacy

SURF wants to provide her employees with digital evidence by awarding edubadges. With edubadges, you can demonstrate that you have certain skills and/or knowledge.

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/surf/informal-edubadges-agreement-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition, the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the issuer (SURF) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [privacy@surf.nl](mailto:privacy@surf.nl).
