# Edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/aeres/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Stichting Aeres Groep is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Edubadges, including Microcredentials, are used with the aim of better positioning participants of the refresher courses in the changing labor market. An edubadge helps the participants to make the knowledge and skills they master visible and portable. This can facilitate the transition from education to work and also the switching between education.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Stichting Aeres Groep) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [fg@aeres.nl](mailto:fg@aeres.nl).
