# Edubadges Statement of consent
Your education institution is organising a pilot project with Edubadges. In this pilot project, digital badges are issued to students from participating institutions in order to study the advantages, disadvantages, applications and limitations of these badges in practice.

You need an Edubadges account to receive your chosen badge. Consent to the creation of this account is requested through this statement of consent. Here we set out how your personal data is used and how you can consent to the processing of this data.

## What is a badge? 
A badge is a digital identifier (image) that proves the recipient possesses certain knowledge or skills. A badge recipient can share it with others, for example on social media, in a digital CV or with a (potential) employer.

More information on Edubadges is available on [SURFnet's website](https://www.surf.nl/innovatieprojecten/onderwijsinnovatie-met-ict/edubadges-en-microcredentialing.html).

## Receiving a badge
You can register for a badge after creating an Edubadge account. The education institution can award you the badge after you have satisfied the requirements for it. Personal data is required to create this Edubadge account and consent for this is requested in this statement of consent.

Note: participating in this pilot is not mandatory and not participating has no further consequences.

## Personal data
Some personal data is required for the technical operation of Edubadges. These are the eduID as identifier, your first name, surname and email address. This data will only be processed by your education institution and its processor: SURFnet. The data will be kept until 31 December 2020.

## Withdrawal of consent
If you wish to withdraw the consent you have given, send an email to that effect to [info@edubadges.nl](mailto:info@edubadges.nl). You will be contacted within three working days to discuss the further procedure. All badges and personal data concerning you will be erased after the withdrawal of consent.

## More information
