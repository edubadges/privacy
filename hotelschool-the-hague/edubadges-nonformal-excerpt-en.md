# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/hotelschool-the-hague/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Hotelschool The Hague is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Within Hotelschool The Hague, informal badges are used as a recognition of knowledge/skills that have been acquired extra-curricular, so not linked to accredited education. Added value is to make the extracurricular acquired skills visible to the outside world, e.g. to employers. These badges can also offer students insight and reflection on which additional knowledge and skills they have acquired.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Hotelschool The Hague) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [l.m.bal@hotelschool.nl](mailto:l.m.bal@hotelschool.nl).
