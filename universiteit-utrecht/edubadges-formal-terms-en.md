# Privacy Statement Formal edubadges

Utrecht University, located at Heidelberglaan 8, 3584 CS Utrecht, wants to handle the personal data of everyone who applies for an edubadge in a careful manner. In this Privacy Statement we inform you about the purposes for which personal data are processed, how you can exercise your privacy rights as well as other information which may be of interest to you. If you have any questions, comments or concerns after reading this privacy statement, please send an email to [privacy@uu.nl](mailto:privacy@uu.nl).

This Privacy Statement applies to all activities related to the edubadges of Utrecht University, hereinafter referred to as UU. UU handles personal data with due care and acts within the limits of the law, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

## 1) Introduction of edubadges
Edubadges can be used to give substance to "lifelong learning" and flexibilisation within and outside UU. The purpose of the edubadge is to make the knowledge and skills that you master visible and portable. As a recipient of an edubadge, you can share it with others, for example on social media, in a digital resume, with an educational institution or with a (potential) employer. With SURF's Edubadges platform, UU can create and issue edubadges. You can request and receive edubadges via this platform. There is a distinction between formal and non-formal edubadges. This Privacy Statement applies to formal and non-formal badges.

## 2) Responsibility
The UU is the data controller, as referred to in the GDPR, for requesting and issuing edubadges. UU believes it is essential that the personal data of its students and employees are handled and secured with the greatest possible care. We also want to be open about how your data is processed by us. That is why we would like to elaborate upon this in this Privacy Statement. We always comply with the requirements set out by the GDPR. If you have any questions about our processing, please contact [privacy@uu.nl](mailto:privacy@uu.nl).

## 3) What Personal data do we proces and why do we proces it?
Your Personal data is being processed will be used by UU to register, generate and issue valid and personal edubadges. The issue of the edubadge by UU can only be carried out by using your personal data. UU processes this data on the legal bases of "public interest" and “legitimate interest”. The table below includes personal data (with purpose and basis) that are processed by students. To request an edubadge, the institution's account is verified with the eduID. To generate a badge, the eduID is used for identification and validation. A badge is therefore also personal data in itself. 

| Personal data	| Processing Goal	| Legal basis |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| First name | To identify the receiver of the edubadge | Student as data subject: public interest. Not a student as data subject: legitimate interest. |
| Surname	| To identify the receiver of the edubadge | Student as data subject: public interest. Not a student as data subject: legitimate interest. |
| Email address	| To notify the receiver of the edubadge | Student as data subject: public interest. Not a student as data subject: legitimate interest. |
| Scoped affiliation	| Used to obtain all educational institutions associated with the recipient's eduID | Student as data subject: public interest. Not a student as data subject: legitimate interest. |
| Agreement privacy questions	| A record is kept of whether the privacy questions have been agreed to | Student as data subject: public interest. Not a student as data subject: legitimate interest. |
| eduID	| The eduID is used as a unique identifier in the database and as a pseudonymous identifier in badges | Student as data subject: public interest. Not a student as data subject: legitimate interest. |
| Edubadge and its contents | To generate and issue the edubadges | Student as data subject: public interest. Not a student as data subject: legitimate interest. |

Part of the processing takes place on the basis of legitimate interest. In the context of this legitimate interest, the following has been considered:

The underlying interest of Utrecht University is that it wants to keep up with educational innovations. As formal interest, it wants to give substance to 'lifelong learning' and to 'making education more flexible', two goals described in the 2016-2020 and 2020-2025 strategic plans. These goals can be achieved and this interest served by the deployment of Edubadges.

In principle, it is in the interest of employees and external persons not to see their data processed. This is an option that they possess, since the pilot functions as an opt-in. If employees and external personnel do not want to participate, they are free to not do so.

In addition, employees of Utrecht University and external personnel have an interest in this innovation. After all, they do participate in lifelong learning and thus also benefit from the flexibilisation of the education they receive. So if their data is processed in this pilot, they will receive something in return in the form of participation in the pilot Edubadges. Given that the Edubadges do not yet represent any actual educational value, it can be argued that what this group of data subjects receives in return for their personal data is not in proportion to their personal data being processed. However, employees and the external personnel are free to opt-in to this processing. As such, they themselves are able to make a final assessment.

All in all, it can be concluded here that Utrecht University has a legitimate interest when it comes to this processing of personal data and that the privacy interests of those involved do not outweigh this interest. Ultimately, this is mainly because the data subjects commit to the processing themselves, and are in the position to also make their own assessment, as well as the fact that the data subjects receive something in return for their personal data being processed.

## 4) With whom do we share your data?
UU has access to all personal data. On behalf of UU and for the implementation of the agreement, the Edubadge platform provides certain parts of the service. UU has made agreements with this processor to guarantee confidential and careful handling of personal data. These agreements are contractually laid down in the so-called 'processor agreement'.

## 5) How does UU ensure confidential handling of personal data?
UU applies appropriate security measures to optimally protect your personal data against unauthorized access or use. We report (attempted) abuse. UU also takes organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized access.

## 6) How can you view, correct or delete your data?
You can send a request to receive a copy of, remove or rectify your personal data to UU. Please indicate clearly that it concerns an inspection or correction request based on the GDPR. You can contact UU at [privacy@uu.nl](mailto:privacy@uu.nl) to exercise the following rights:

You can send the data request to UU at [privacy@uu.nl](mailto:privacy@uu.nl). Please indicate clearly that it concerns a request based on the GDPR.
