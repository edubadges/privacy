# Edubadges and Your Privacy

Below is important information about edubadges and your privacy. Leiden University works together with SURF to issue edubadges. SURF provides the edubadges platform. Besides that, you can manage your own edubadges in your backpack, for which SURF is responsible. For more information about edubadges, check the [SURF](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/educational-logistics/edubadges) website.

## Issuing Edubadges

To give you an edubadge, Leiden University needs to use some of your personal data. Leiden University is responsible for this. The following data is used: your first name, last name, a unique ID, and your email address. The edubadge also contains your eduID and extra info, like the time it was given, the issuer (Leiden University), and details about your achievement, course module, or learning result. If you have more questions about privacy, check the [student privacy statement](https://www.organisatiegids.universiteitleiden.nl/en/regulations/general/privacy-statements). Wherever it says "student", you can read "learner". And wherever it mentions sending personal data to DUO, you can add "if applicable".

## Managing Backpacks

SURF is responsible for managing the platform and backpacks, and for processing the personal data needed for this. For more information about how SURF handles your data, check the [edubadges privacy statement](https://edubadges.nl/).
