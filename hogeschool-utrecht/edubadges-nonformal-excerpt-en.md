# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/https://github.com/edubadges/privacy/blob/master/hogeschool-utrecht//edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Utrecht University of Applied Sciences is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. By using digital badges, Hogeschool Utrecht enables the students and participant to visibly present their acquired competences at other educational institutions and social media such as LinkedIN. With badges the students and participants are enabled to be in charge of their own choices regarding the learning progress and respective learning process.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Utrecht University of Applied Sciences) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes.
