Edubadges Privacy Statement - EN
================================

 

University Example
------------------

 

Thank you for checking out the privacy statement for the Edubadges pilot! The
SURFnet Edubadges Team has paid a great deal of attention to the protection of
your personal data and you can read all about it here. If you have any questions
or concerns while reading this privacy statement, please send an email to
info\@edubadges.nl or contact your own educational institution.

1 Introduction to Edubadges
---------------------------

A badge is a digital badge (image) that demonstrates that the recipient has
certain knowledge or skills. The recipient of a badge can share it with others,
for example on social media, a digital CV or with a (potential) employer. The
Edubadges pilot enables educational institutions, students and staff to
experiment with these badges. More information about Edubadges can be found on
[SURF's
website](https://www.surf.nl/innovatieprojecten/onderwijsinnovatie-met-ict/edubadges-en-microcredentialing.html).

2 Personal data
---------------

### What data do we use and why?

In 2018, educational institutions that fall within SURFnet's target group were
given the opportunity to take part in the Edubadges pilot. Within the scope of
this pilot project, the educational institution sets its own objectives with
regard to the use of Edubadges. Within the framework of the General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), the educational institution is the data
controller.

provides the technical infrastructure for Edubadges and acts as a processor
within the framework of the GDPR.

Various kinds of personal data are required for the operation of Edubadges and
for registering, issuing and receiving badges. Because the Edubadges pilot is an
optional programme, consent for almost all personal data is requested. All
personal data will be used exclusively for Edubadges. Do you wish to withdraw
your consent? You can inform us in an e-mail to info\@edubadges.nl. We will
contact you within three working days to coordinate the next stage of the
procedure. Once you have withdrawn your consent, all of your badges and personal
data will be deleted.
