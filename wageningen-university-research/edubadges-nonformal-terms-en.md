`December 2020`

Welcome to the edubadges platform. edubadges is the digital certificates platform for the Dutch education community and is hosted by SURF. Wageningen University & Research (WUR) is handing out edubadges to recognize achieved learning outcomes. With this Privacy Statement, WUR indicates which personal data is collected and for which purpose. In addition, you can read about your rights as a data subject and how to contact us.  

## What we do with your personal data
WUR in cooperation with SURF collect personal data obtained through the use of the edubadges platform. The edubadges - if requested by students - are stored in the platform. Students can collect edubadges on the platform in their edubadges backpack and can decide themselves where and with whom to share them, e.g. with employers or other educational institutions. This data has been collected for the following purposes.

*	Issuing badges; (required) Full name, EduID, email address, publishing institute, owned badges (including module and achievement), education, date and time of issuing badges;

## Do we share personal data?
As a general principle, WUR nor SURF edubadges do not disclose your personal data to third parties, unless this is necessary for the functioning of the app and/or the provision of a service. This means that, for example, we try to minimize the use of cookies and keep the sharing of data with partners to a minimum.

The student shares this data with the host of the edubadges platform, SURF, whereby data is not further shared. This is necessary, because SURF is the host of the edubadges platform. The student can itself decide whether data may be shared to others.

An important exception is the sharing of personal data when it is required under applicable law or in course of any legal proceedings. In that case, the WUR and/or SURF must share data with authoritative bodies, for example with law enforcement. This will occur, however, under supervision of a privacy officer.

## How long we retain your data
edubadges are stored in perpetuity. As a badge owner one can decide to remove the Edubadge from the platform. Only thereafter it will be deleted. This also occurs when a student end their subscription to this platform.

## How do we protect your personal data?
Obviously, the processing of personal data includes appropriate security measures. Therefore, edubadges is secured and we also demand that of our partners. WURâ€™s starting point is NEN-EN-ISO/IEC 27002:2017 to make sure that personal data is optimally secured. This edubadges service has been checked by these WUR standards.
