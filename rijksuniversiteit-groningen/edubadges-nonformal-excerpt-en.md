# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/rijksuniversiteit-groningen/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

The University of Groningen is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. The University of Groningen uses edubadges to give substance to "lifelong learning" and flexible education within and outside the university. The purpose of the edubadge is to make the knowledge and skills that you master visible and portable.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (University of Groningen) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [privacy@rug.nl](mailto:privacy@rug.nl).
