# Privacy statement regarding Edubadges

## Introduction
The University of Groningen (UG) aims to take good care of your personal information. The UG is legally responsible in this respect and takes this responsibility seriously. This privacy statement explains how the UG processes your personal details in light of the provision of edubadges and sets out your rights. This privacy statement is supplementary to the UG’s General Privacy Statement ([link](https://www.rug.nl/about-us/organization/rules-and-regulations/algemeen/regeling-bescherming-persoonsgegevens)). In the event of inconsistency, this privacy statement regarding edubadges takes precedence.

## Aims and principles of the processing of personal data
Edubadges can be used to give shape to life-long learning and a higher degree of flexibility in teaching at the University. With an edubadge, you can make the knowledge and skills that you possess visible and transferable. You can display the edubadge on your social media channels or on your digital CV. To facilitate this, the UG works together with SURF, the overarching organization for IT services in higher education. SURF provides a platform for the creation, granting, and retention of edubadges. There is a distinction between formal and informal edubadges. A formal badge shows that you have followed an accredited degree programme or accredited course unit at university, for which you have been granted ECTS credit points. An informal badge shows that you have followed a course, post-academic programme, or other non-accredited programme.

To be able to award edubadges, the UG processes your personal data. These data are necessary to be able to identify you and to link the edubadge to you. For formal edubadges, the rationale for the processing of data is the UG’s duty in the public interest to provide university-level teaching. For informal edubadges, the rationale lies in the agreements concluded with you through which the teaching is offered to you.

## Processed personal data
The UG processes the following personal data of yours:
* Name and surname
* Email address
* EduID
* Edubadge and its contents
* Unique identifier to award edubadges directly to a student

## People handling your personal data
The UG has access to your personal data. On behalf of the UG, SURF B.V. manages the edubadge platform and handles the accompanying service provision. SURF is the processor of the UG and written agreements have thus been made with SURF to safeguard the security and careful handling of your personal data.

## Retention period
To retain your edubadge, your personal data are stored for an indefinite period. If you no longer need your edubadge, you can report this to the UG by sending an email to privacy@rug.nl. The UG will subsequently stop processing your personal data for the retention of your edubadge.

## Your rights
You have various rights under privacy legislation. You can contact the UG to exercise these rights. Your request will be assessed and processed within one month of receipt. Before a request is processed, we must ensure that it has been submitted by a person authorized to do so and that it is legitimate. This is why you may be asked for your ID before the request is taken into consideration.

You have the right to request an overview of your personal data that has been processed, including all processing of this data. If you believe that your personal data is incorrect or if you no longer want it to be processed, you can file a request to have your data adjusted or to stop the processing of your data and have it removed. In certain cases, you are also entitled to a copy of your personal data in a usable format. In order to assess and process your request, your personal data will naturally be processed.

In addition to the right to address questions, requests, and complaints to the UG, you have the right to file a complaint with the supervisory authority. In the Netherlands, this is the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens (Dutch Data Protection Authority).

## Changes to this privacy statement
The UG is authorized to change this privacy statement. Valid reasons for doing so include amendment(s) to laws and regulations or new laws and regulations, changes to the General Privacy Policy of the UG and advances in technology. You will naturally be informed of any changes in good time.
