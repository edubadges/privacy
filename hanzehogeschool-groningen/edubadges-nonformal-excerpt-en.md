# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/hanzehogeschool-groningen/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Hanze University of Applied Sciences is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. The students receive edubadges as part of the total Honors certificate for the Honors talentprogramme, so that they can demonstrate that they have completed parts of this Honors talentprogramme.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Hanze University of Applied Sciences) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [ict-security@org.hanze.nl](mailto:ict-security@org.hanze.nl).
