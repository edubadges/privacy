# Terms of use for this edubadge

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/zuyd-hogeschool/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Zuyd Hogeschool is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Introducing micro-credentials for professionals can be a huge boost for Life Long Learning (LLO). As an institution, our ambition is to tailor our teaching and education to lifelong learning. The scope and value of micro-credentials make it attractive for professionals to specialize, upskill, or retrain in higher education and become certified in the skills they have acquired.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifiere and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Zuyd Hogeschool) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [functionarisgegevensbescherming@zuyd.nl](mailto:functionarisgegevensbescherming@zuyd.nl).
