# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/tu-delft/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Delft University of Technology is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Non formal edubadges will provide learners with evidence of mastering a particular activity, skill or area of knowledge as a result of intentional effort that takes place outside formal learning environments, but within some kind of organisational framework.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Delft University of Technology) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [privacy-tud@tudelft.nl](mailto:privacy-tud@tudelft.nl).
