`Versie 1.0 â€“ 11 november 2020`

Thank you for taking the time to read the UM privacy statement with regard to edubadges. We have devoted a great deal of attention to the protection of your personal data and you can read all about this in this privacy statement. This privacy statement is an addendum of [Maastricht University General Privacy Statement](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/um-general-privacy-statement#).

# 1 Introduction to edubadges
An edubadge is a form of digital recognition or digital badge (image) which shows that the holder has certain knowledge or skills or has successfully completed an activity that is recognized by the institute who awards the badge.
You can apply for edubadges through a separate process within your institute.

The recipient of an edubadge can share it with others, for example on social media, on a digital CV, or with an educational institution or (potential) employer.

A technical infrastructure is required in order to create and award edubadges. SURF (the collaborative organisation for ICT in Dutch education and research) has developed the infrastructure for issuing edubadges; the edubadges are stored securely and can be validated within SURF's systems. Authorized Maastricht University employees have access to the backend to Maastricht University edubadge environment, in order to manage, created, and award badges. You can store your edubadge in the so-called backpack system, provided by SURF

If you have any questions about this process, please contact [edubadges@maastrichtuniversity.nl](mailto:edubadges@maastrichtuniversity.nl).

# 2 Data processing
The edubadges service is divided into two parts:

* Account/backpack (1) -> SURF is controller, see [SURF's privacy statement](https://edubadges.nl/privacy).
  * Creating and maintaining an account
  * Storing edubadges in the backpack
  * Validating edubadges
* Issuing edubadges (2) -> provided by Maastricht University and SURF acts as Data Processor.
  * Registering for edubadges
  * Creating an edubadge
  * Issuing an edubadge

# 3.1 What personal data do we process and why?
In order to process your edubadge request, it is necessary to store and process the following personal data:
* EduID (identifier)
* First name(s)
* Family name
* Email address
* Institute
* Time of issue
* Your specific badges

The edubadge also contains information such as the educational module, and/or learning outcomes, a description, and criteria. If applicable, it may also contain a URL for more information on the program or activity connected with the badge, study load, educational identifiers, and relevant national or EU education frameworks, a unique text provided by the person who is awarded the badge, e.g. a reflection to the learning process.

Two groups of users are distinguished during data processing operations:
1. Edubadge recipients: Natural persons having a user account.
2. Guests: Natural persons viewing edubadges without an account.

Edubadges essentially last for a lifetime, granted that you keep your Edubadge safely, e.g. in SURF backpack. This is your responsibility.

As the owner of an edubadge, you can make the edubadge publicly available in your account/backpack. This allows the edubadge to be verified, for example, by a potential employer or an educational institution.

# 4 Security
Adequate technical and organizational security measures are part of the data processing agreement with SURF. Strict employee account roles in edubadges safeguard that access remains limited to only personal data relevant to them.

# 5 Your personal data rights
Please view [Maastricht University General Privacy Statement](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/um-general-privacy-statement#) for your personal data rights.

# 6 Amendments to the privacy statement
We may amend this privacy statement from time to time. We therefore advise you to consult this privacy statement regularly.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns after reading this privacy statement, please feel free to contact [privacy@maastrichtuniversity.nl](mailto:privacy@maastrichtuniversity.nl).
