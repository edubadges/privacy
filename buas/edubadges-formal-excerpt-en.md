# Terms of use for this edubadge

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/buas/edubadges-formal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Breda University of Applied Sciences is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. Breda University of Applied Sciences uses edubadges for recognising and appreciating knowledge, skills and behaviours from formal and non-formal education aiming to better position learners at the changing job market. Three tracks can be pursued, one by students, one by employees and one by professionals:
* Students: edubadges for 21st-century knowledge and skills that students acquire via extracurricular activities such as information skills, public speaking, sustainability initiatives, etc.
* Employees: edubadges in the context of professionalising BUas staff in various domains such as didactics, digital literacy, and more.
* Professionals: BUas wants to experiment with edubadges for microcredentials to arrive at balanced advice for a badge strategy aimed at professionals in the context of Lifelong Learning.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifiere and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Breda University of Applied Sciences) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [fg@buas](mailto:fg@buas).
