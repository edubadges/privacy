# edubadges and your privacy

Below are the most important points about edubadges and your privacy. In the [full version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edubadges/privacy/master/ipabo/edubadges-nonformal-text-en.md) detailed information about this processing can be found.

Hogeschool IPABO is the controller and SURF is the processor for issuing edubadges. For the edubadges platform to function, it is necessary to process your personal data. In the context of making education more flexible and making lifelong learning possible, Hogeschool IPABO issues edubadges. The edubadge enables the owner to better position himself in the labor market and demonstrates that the owner has certain knowledge and skills. This fits in with our vision of flexible education.

To issue edubadges, your first name, last name, a unique identifier and email address are processed. In addition the edubadge contains your eduID and supplementary information such as the time of issue, the publisher (Hogeschool IPABO) and information about the achievement, educational module and/or learning outcomes. If you have any questions about your privacy, please contact [f.kool@ipabo.nl](mailto:f.kool@ipabo.nl).
